Got it—let’s zoom in on (1) **what `setsockopt` really does** and the options that matter for an HTTP server, and (2) a **step-by-step plan for a scalable, non-blocking server** using an event loop (epoll/kqueue/poll). No code, just concrete guidance.

# 1) `setsockopt` — what, when, where, and why

**Purpose:** tweak kernel behavior for a socket. You choose:

* **which level** you’re configuring (e.g., `SOL_SOCKET`, `IPPROTO_TCP`, `IPPROTO_IPV6`)
* **which option** (e.g., `SO_REUSEADDR`)
* **the value** (int/struct)
* **when** to set it (before bind/listen, or after `accept()` for per-connection tuning)

Think of each option as a small policy knob. Some apply to the **listening socket**; some to **accepted client sockets**; a few can be set on both.

## The options that matter most for a basic HTTP server

### Pre-bind / pre-listen (listening socket)

* **`SO_REUSEADDR` (SOL\_SOCKET)**
  Allows `bind()` to succeed even if the port is in `TIME_WAIT` from previous runs. Safe and recommended on Unix-like systems. Set **before** `bind()`.

* **`SO_REUSEPORT` (SOL\_SOCKET)**
  Lets **multiple** sockets bind the *same* IP\:port on the same host.

  * **Linux:** enables kernel load-balancing across processes/threads each with their own listening socket. All listeners must set it, same protocol, same options. Good for multi-process designs.
  * **BSD/macOS:** historically different semantics, but also used for load distribution.
    Use only if you actually run multiple acceptors; otherwise skip.

* **`IPV6_V6ONLY` (IPPROTO\_IPV6)**
  On an IPv6 socket: `0` = dual stack (accepts IPv4-mapped), `1` = IPv6 only.
  If you want a single IPv6 socket to serve both IPv6 and IPv4, make sure it’s **off** (system default varies). Set **before** `bind()`.

* **Backlog choice for `listen()`**
  Not a `setsockopt`, but related: the *backlog* caps pending connections. Choose a reasonably high value (e.g., 256–1024). Kernel may clamp to `SOMAXCONN`.

### Immediately after `accept()` (per-connection socket)

* **`TCP_NODELAY` (IPPROTO\_TCP)**
  Disables Nagle’s algorithm. For HTTP/1.1, it often improves latency for small responses/headers. Many servers enable it.

* **`SO_KEEPALIVE` (SOL\_SOCKET)** (+ TCP keepalive tunables)
  Detects dead peers on long-lived idle connections (keep-alive).

  * `SO_KEEPALIVE=1` enables it.
  * On Linux, tune via `TCP_KEEPIDLE`/`TCP_KEEPINTVL`/`TCP_KEEPCNT`.
    Use with sensible timeouts if you expect lots of long-lived idle connections.

* **`SO_RCVBUF` / `SO_SNDBUF` (SOL\_SOCKET)**
  Adjust kernel buffers. Defaults are usually fine. If you serve large files at scale, you might tune upward.

* **`SO_LINGER` (SOL\_SOCKET)**
  Controls behavior on `close()`. Usually leave **disabled** for HTTP servers; enabling it aggressively can create surprises (blocking closes or RSTs).

* **SIGPIPE suppression**
  Not a `setsockopt` on Linux: prefer `MSG_NOSIGNAL` on writes or ignore `SIGPIPE`.
  On macOS/BSD, there’s **`SO_NOSIGPIPE`** per-socket.

### Optional / advanced (platform-specific)

* **`TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` (Linux)**
  Wakes your acceptor only when data arrives (not just handshake). Good against empty connects/slowloris. Set on the listening socket.

* **`TCP_FASTOPEN` (Linux/BSD)**
  Allows sending data during SYN. Helps first-byte latency behind CDNs or for TLS, but adds complexity. Enable later, not in v1.

> **Where to set:**
>
> * **Listening socket:** `SO_REUSEADDR`, `SO_REUSEPORT`, `IPV6_V6ONLY`, `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT`, `TCP_FASTOPEN`.
> * **Accepted sockets:** `TCP_NODELAY`, `SO_KEEPALIVE` (+ TCP keepalive params), `SO_NOSIGPIPE` (if on macOS/BSD), buffer sizes.
> * **Timeouts:** With **non-blocking I/O**, *don’t* rely on `SO_RCVTIMEO/SO_SNDTIMEO`—use your event loop + timers.

# 2) Scalable design (non-blocking + event loop) — step-by-step

Below assumes **Linux + epoll**. I’ll note BSD/macOS **kqueue** parallels where useful, and a poll/select fallback.

## A. One-time setup

1. **Choose your addressing model**

   * Single IPv6 listening socket, dual-stack if allowed (`IPV6_V6ONLY=0`), or separate IPv4+IPv6 sockets.
   * Bind to `::` (IPv6 any) or `0.0.0.0` (IPv4 any) as needed.

2. **Create the listening socket(s)**

   * Mark **close-on-exec** (CLOEXEC) so fds don’t leak to child processes.
   * Set **non-blocking** (critical for event loops).
   * Set **SO\_REUSEADDR** (and `SO_REUSEPORT` only if you’ll actually run multiple listeners).
   * Optionally set **TCP\_DEFER\_ACCEPT** (Linux) to reduce wakeups.

3. **Bind + listen**

   * Bind to chosen address/port, then `listen(backlog)`. Pick a healthy backlog (e.g., 512+).

4. **Create event loop instance**

   * **epoll:** `epoll_create1(CLOEXEC)`; register the listening fd with `EPOLLIN` (readable) and `EPOLLRDHUP` (peer half-close detection).
   * **Level-triggered** is simplest to start; you can move to **edge-triggered** later for fewer wakeups.
   * **kqueue:** register with `EVFILT_READ` and `EV_CLEAR` if you want edge-like behavior.

5. **Global resources**

   * **Connection table / pool:** track per-fd state (read buf, write buf, parser state, timestamps).
   * **Timer system:** for timeouts (header read, body read, write, idle keep-alive). On Linux, `timerfd` works well with epoll; or use a min-heap / timing wheel and a single periodic timerfd tick.

## B. Accepting new connections

6. **Event: listening socket readable**

   * **Accept in a loop** until you get “would block.”

     * On Linux, prefer **`accept4`** with `NONBLOCK | CLOEXEC` to avoid races.
   * For each new client fd:

     * Set **TCP\_NODELAY=1** (optional but common for HTTP/1.1).
     * Set **SO\_KEEPALIVE=1** (and keepalive tunables if you use them).
     * Register the fd with the loop for **read events** (`EPOLLIN | EPOLLRDHUP`).
     * Initialize per-connection state: `READ_HEADERS`, empty buffers, last\_activity=now.

> **Why accept in a loop?** With a non-blocking listener, the kernel may have queued multiple connections. Read them all now; otherwise you’ll get extra wakeups.

## C. Reading requests (non-blocking)

7. **Event: client fd has `EPOLLIN`**

   * **Read in a loop** into your receive buffer until you hit “would block” or an error/close. Expect partial reads.
   * **Cap header size** (e.g., 16–32 KB). If you’ve read `\r\n\r\n` (end of headers), stop parsing headers. If exceeded limits → 413/431, close or respond then close.
   * **Parse request line + headers** (case-insensitive names).

     * Validate: method (support GET/HEAD first), HTTP/1.1 version, `Host` present, sane path (no NULs, no traversal, validate bytes → then percent-decode).
     * Determine **keep-alive** policy (HTTP/1.1 default keep-alive; close on `Connection: close` or on errors).
   * If a **request body** is expected (POST/PUT later), read per framing:

     * `Content-Length: N` → read exactly N bytes (across multiple reads).
     * `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` → parse chunks; you can defer this until you implement POST.

8. **Request ready → produce a response plan**

   * Route: static file lookup under docroot (normalize path; resolve index.html; forbid `..`).
   * Gather metadata: status, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Date`, `Connection`.
   * Build response **headers** into a contiguous buffer.
   * For the **body**:

     * Small responses: copy into a write buffer.
     * Large files: prefer **`sendfile`** on Linux to avoid extra copies (note: disk I/O can still block; see below).
   * Switch the connection’s interest to **write** events if you have bytes to send (or keep `EPOLLIN | EPOLLOUT` if you pipeline work).

## D. Writing responses (non-blocking)

9. **Event: client fd has `EPOLLOUT`**

   * **Write in a loop**: attempt to write all pending header/body bytes until “would block” or done. Expect **partial writes**; keep track of unsent tail.
   * When you finish sending the current response:

     * If **keep-alive** and not closing:

       * Clear `EPOLLOUT` interest if you have nothing more to send; keep `EPOLLIN` to await the next request on the same connection.
       * Reset parsing state and buffers (but keep the connection object).
     * If **closing**: schedule close (see “shutdown and cleanup”).

## E. Timeouts & resource limits

10. **Per-connection timers**

* **Header read timeout** (e.g., 5–10s): if no complete headers by then, respond 408/close.
* **Body read timeout** (if applicable).
* **Write timeout** (stalled client).
* **Idle keep-alive timeout** (e.g., 10–30s): if no new request, close to free resources.
  Implement with a timerfd tick + min-heap of deadlines, or per-connection timerfd (heavier).

11. **Global limits**

* Max concurrent connections (guard memory).
* Max requests per connection (e.g., cap at 100), then close.
* ulimit/rlimits: raise **max open files** for the process.

## F. Closing connections cleanly

12. **Detect peer close**

* You’ll see `EPOLLRDHUP` or read() returns 0.

13. **Server-initiated close**

* Finish writing any in-flight response if possible, or abort on fatal error.
* Remove fd from event loop, close fd, reclaim buffers.
* Avoid double-close races; watch for events arriving after free (defensive bookkeeping).

## G. Concurrency patterns inside the loop

14. **Single loop thread (good starting point)**

* One thread owns epoll and all connections. Simple and surprisingly capable.

15. **Multi-threaded**

* **Option A: One epoll + worker pool**

  * Use `EPOLLONESHOT` on fds; a worker that starts handling a connection will re-arm interest when done to avoid concurrent handling of the same fd.
  * Workers should never block on network I/O (still non-blocking).
* **Option B: N event loops**

  * Use `SO_REUSEPORT` with N listeners; each thread has its own epoll and accepts independently (good scalability, less cross-thread coordination).

## H. Filesystem I/O (important caveat)

16. **Disk I/O can block even if sockets don’t**

* `read()`/`open()` on files may block under cache misses; **sendfile** helps (kernel-mediated copy) but can still be limited by disk.
* Two common approaches:

  * Keep the event loop **single-threaded** for network, and offload blocking file reads to a **small thread pool**.
  * Or rely on OS cache + sendfile and keep files modest; measure and revisit later.

## I. kqueue / poll / select notes

17. **kqueue (BSD/macOS)**

* Register listening and client sockets with `EVFILT_READ`; add `EVFILT_WRITE` when you have pending writes.
* Use `EV_CLEAR` (edge-triggered).

18. **poll/select fallback**

* Usable for learning or small loads; less scalable due to O(n) wakeups and fd set limits (select). The state machine is the same.

## J. Hardening & polish

19. **Slowloris defense**: header read timeout + `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` + header size cap.
20. **Request validation**: strict path normalization; reject illegal bytes and ambiguous encodings.
21. **HTTP correctness**: exactly one body framing (`Content-Length` *or* chunked), correct CRLF usage, proper `HEAD` behavior.
22. **Logging**: method, path, status, bytes, duration, client IP; error log for parse/timeouts/syscall failures.

## Quick checklists

**Listening socket (before bind):**

* Non-blocking, CLOEXEC
* `SO_REUSEADDR=1`
* Optional `SO_REUSEPORT=1` (multi-acceptors)
* Optional `IPV6_V6ONLY` (if you want IPv6-only)
* Optional `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` (Linux)
* `listen(backlog>=256)`

**Accepted socket (right after accept):**

* Non-blocking, CLOEXEC (use accept4 if available)
* `TCP_NODELAY=1`
* `SO_KEEPALIVE=1` (+ tune TCP keepalive if needed)
* Register with loop for `READ` (and `RDHUP`)
* Initialize per-connection state + timers

**Event handling:**

* On `READ`: loop read → parse → build response plan → enable `WRITE` if you have data
* On `WRITE`: loop write → if flushed and keep-alive, disable `WRITE`, reset to read next request
* On timeouts/errors/RDHUP: close and clean up

If you tell me your target OS (Linux vs macOS/BSD) and whether you want **one loop thread** or **SO\_REUSEPORT with N loops**, I can tailor these steps into a tighter, ready-to-implement checklist for that exact setup (still no code).
